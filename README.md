# Space Sim 2D

Space Sim 2D is a simple 2D space simulation written in Java where you can create celestial objects, control a spaceship, and explore the fundamentals of orbital mechanics and gravitational interactions.

## How to Play

1. **Create Objects**: 
   - Click and drag on the screen to create celestial objects. 
   - The drag distance and direction determine the object's initial velocity.
   - Scroll up/down to change the size of objects before creating them.
   - Scroll left/right to adjust the density of new objects, affecting their gravitational pull and mass.

2. **Delete Objects**: 
   - Right-click on any existing object to remove it from the simulation.

3. **Control the Ship**: 
   - Right-click on empty space to create a player-controlled ship. 
   - Move your mouse around the ship to apply force and navigate through space.
   - The further the mouse is from the ship, the stronger the force applied.
